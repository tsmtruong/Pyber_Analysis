# Pyber Ride Sharing Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to perfrom an analysis on a ride sharing platform named Pyber, to get a clearer picture and understanding of the metrics by the types of cities. This analysis utilizes both DataFrames and charts to display the performance of the ride sharing platform in these different cities. This will allow executives to improve access in cities that need it as well as affordability in underserved areas.

## Results

![Ride Information Dataframe](https://github.com/tsmtruong/Pyber_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Screen%20Shot%202022-06-28%20at%202.28.03%20PM.jpg)

The information shown above shows that the urban cities have 1000 more rides than suburban cities and 1500 more rides than rural cities. The disparity in the amount of drivers per city is even larger at upwards of 2000 dirver difference. While the amount of total fares in the urban area is the highest the average fare per ride was $10 more in a rural area than that of an urban area. This however could be due to the distance traveled rather than fare price as things are more widespread in a rual area than an urban area. The average fare per driver was also disproportionaly higher in a rural area than in an urban area with the average rural fare per driver being baout $55 dollars and the urban average fare per driver being about $16.

The line chart above shows the weekly fare by city type. These are the weekly fare incomes in USD by city. As shown the yellow line (Urban) by far has the higest fare income while the blueline (Rural) has the lowest weekly fares with the second week getting close to $0 and the higest never going over $500.


## Summary

Based on the analysis results I would suggest offering driver incentives to drivers in rural areas to increase the amount of drivers and help lower the average fare as a lower average fare may help increase the number of customers. The company could also implement a carpool option for rural areas to help decrease the average fare per ride as the fare in Rural areas are much higher than urban and suburban areas, this could help customers with decreased cost and give drivers more incentive to start driving with the app as they are completing more rides. The platform to help underserved areas could offer coupons or discounted rates during certain hours for areas where the prices are much higher. These would be my three suggestions to the company that I believe would best benefit the comapny and the customers.
